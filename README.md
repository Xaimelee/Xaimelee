### Greetings!

I'm a Game Modder, Indie Game Developer and currently a student for Advanced Software Development. Currently I am situated in New Zealand but I do frequently travel to and temporarily live in Australia.

I enjoy and definitely prefer using C# and GDScript for anything Game Developing, primarily using Unity or the Godot Engine. When it comes to modding, which has been primarily for **Europa Universalis IV**, it uses a inhouse scripting language with some elements of LUA.

Speaking of **Europa Universalis IV**, I created a tool for modders to help speed up the creation of mission trees for the game which can be viewed [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2408076990]HERE[/url].

My time as a modder has been fairly active, most noteably participating and for a time running a Multiplayer community and modification for a server consisting of hundreds of players, that being **Hashinshin Multiplayer** or **HashMP** for short.

**Modifications:**
- HashMP
- Rex Europae (update for HashMP)
- Rex

Repos for every modification above can be seen below.

I have a game currently in development done in partnership with a fantastic artist who is also a very experienced Game Developer with released commercial titles. This is still a private project but is code-named 'Loom' with an expected commercial release for later this year for PC.

More recently with becoming a student, I have for the first time delved into web application development, AI tools (chatbots, image recognition), APIs, databases and other server related tools. Coding Languages learned for this so far have been Javascript, HTML and CSS (scss, sass), along with learning the React framework which uses JSX.

**Languages, Applications or Tools Learned:**
- Javascript (Typescript, JSX)
- HTML
- CSS (scss, sass)
- React
- Docker
- Firebase
- IBM Watson

Repos started with 'mr-hq' are related to my time as a student and demonstrate usage of the above.
