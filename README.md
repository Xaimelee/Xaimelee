### Greetings!

I'm a Game Modder, Indie Game Developer, Programmer and was a student for Advanced Software Development. Currently I am situated in New Zealand but I do frequently travel to and temporarily live in Australia.

I enjoy and definitely prefer using C# and GDScript for anything game development, primarily using Unity or the Godot Engine. When it comes to modding, which has been primarily for **Europa Universalis IV**, it uses a inhouse scripting language with some elements of LUA.

Speaking of **Europa Universalis IV**, I created a tool for modders to help speed up the creation of mission trees for the game which can be viewed [HERE](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2408076990). It is a desktop application which outputs txt files with code snippets based off what the user designs. This was made using the Unity Engine.

My time as a modder has been fairly active, most noteably participating and for a time running a Multiplayer community and modification for a server consisting of hundreds of players, that being **Hashinshin Multiplayer** or **HashMP** for short.

**Modifications:**
- [HashMP](https://github.com/PDXMP/HashMP_CE)
- [Rex Europae](https://github.com/Xaimelee/rex_europae)
- [Rex](https://github.com/Xaimelee/Rex)

I am actively developing a game in my spare time which is done in partnership with a fantastic artist who is also a very experienced Game Developer with released commercial titles. This is still a private project but is code-named 'Loom' with an expected commercial release eventually.

Before our current game project together we submitted an entry to a game jam which had a theme for games to be in black and white, this can be viewed [HERE](https://xaimelee.itch.io/just-a-regular-game-of-cards).

More recently with becoming a student, I have for the first time delved into web application development, AI tools (chatbots, image recognition), APIs, databases and other server related tools.

**Languages, Applications or Tools Learned as a Student:**
- Javascript (Typescript, JSX)
- HTML
- CSS (SCSS, SASS)
- React
- React Redux
- Docker
- Firebase Hosting
- IBM Watson
- Snyk 
- Custom Vision 
- MongoDB 
- Express.js 

Repositories started with 'mr-hq' are related to my time as a student and demonstrate usage of the above.

**Mission Ready Projects:**
- [Turners.co.nz, collaborated with UX designers](https://github.com/Xaimelee/mrhq-website)
- [Pet.co.nz, collaborated with UX designers](https://github.com/Xaimelee/mrhq-website-m6)

[xaimelee.github.io](https://github.com/Xaimelee/xaimelee.github.io) currently displays the implementation of a Car Recognition AI.
